Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I chose to create an event tracking app. The app required the user to login. If the user did not already have an account, the app could create an account for the user with the entered username and password. The app needed to incorporated at least 2 tables, one for user events and the other for login creditials. The user's event data needed to be displayed as a grid. The app needed the ability to create, read, update, and delete events. Lastly, the app had to have the ability to notify the user of the events scheduled for the day upon starting it.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app consisted of four screens. I wanted to keep the app simple and intuitive. I kept only the functions that would benefit the user and guide them while using it. The main screen listed all their events and their dates. Each row had its own edit and delete button to prevent confusion and keep things clear. The app utilized a FAB for aesthetics and obviousness so as not to confuse it with any of the other buttons. The event edit screen used a pick a date popup calendar to ensure the correct date is selected. The app even confirmed the date by showing it on the screen after the date was chosen. All the buttons were clear and labeled to ensure that the user knew exactly what they do.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
First I did a lot of research. I read through the Zybooks material, I followed throught app guides, and I studied the developer manuals. Next I created wireframes and data flow charts to help with design and development. I should have created some UMLs because I ended up finding myself struggling with the coding portion. I ended up getting stuck throwing spaghetti at the wall trying to make the app work.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
My code was not functional. I tried a lot of testing and working through the project, but I was not able to get the core mechanics to work. Much of the application was finished, but the tables were broken and not showing properly. This lead me down a spiral I was not able to get out of. I did not give up though. I am determine to get this application working.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There were definitely aspects that I could be better for the user. I would like to implement them, but it is just a matter of being able to work through the problems first. Instead of a grid layout, I wanted to group all the events by date and list them in order by time. This would clear up the screen from duplicate dates and unnessecary clutter. I also wanted to incorporate a search function to help find specific dates or events. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
To be honest, I think it would have been the design element and the login code. Those were the portions of the app where I didn't have any trouble. It was fun doing it. Then I got into the meat of the project and had to grind it out. I want to learn more. Like I said earlier, I have not given up. I plan to finish this app and create more apps in the future to get my practice in and get better.
